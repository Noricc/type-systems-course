* Slogan

  If you read this:
  - you probably already know intuitively how type systems work.
  - Most of the work is about parsing the math.

* Lambda calculus

  - $x$: Variables
  - $\lambda x . t$: Functions
  - $t~x$: Function application

* Typing relation

  $\Gamma \vdash t : T$ means the term $t$ is of type $T$ in the context $\Gamma$
